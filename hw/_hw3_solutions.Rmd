# Introduction

You will be managing factors and creating some basic plots in this homework assignment. The data sets you will use come from two places, `NCbirths` which you will have to read in below, and the `planes` data set which comes part of the `nycflights13` package. The `planes` data set contains data on plane characteristics such as the number of engines. 

The code chunk below sets some code chunk options (using `opts_chunk` from the `knitr` package) to make your knitted report output more readable. I encourage you to play around with these options to learn how they work. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=5, fig.align='center') 
library(ggplot2)
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
df <- read.csv("https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/NCbirths.csv")
```

You can use a combination of base and `ggplot2` graphics for this lab. Your answers can be for your eyes only (exploratory). They do not have to be pretty.  


## How many passengers can a plane hold before needing another engine? 
This question uses the `planes` data set. Let's load that into our working environment so we can look at it.
```{r}
data(planes)
```


1. Examine the variable `engines` using `table()` and `class`. What is it's data type? 

The variable engines has data type integer.

```{r}
class(planes$engines)
table(planes$engines)
```


2. There are too few planes with more than 2 engines. Recode all records with 4 engines to a value of 3. _Hint: Revisit lesson 04_. Create a `table` of this variable again to ensure that all 4's are now 3's. 

```{r}
planes$engines[planes$engines == 4] <- 3
table(planes$engines)
```


3. Create a new factor variable `num_engines` from `engines` with labels "one", "two", "three+". 
Make sure you create this new variable as part of the `planes` data set. (i.e. `planes$num_engines <-` )

```{r}
planes$num_engines <- factor(planes$engines, labels=c("one", "two", "three+"))
table(planes$num_engines)
```


4. Create a two-way `table` of `engines` against `num_engines` to confirm that this new factor variable was created correctly. 

```{r}
table(planes$engines, planes$num_engines)
```


# Univariate plots
This section uses data from both the `NCbirths` and the `planes` data sets. 


1. A table of marital status (`marital`) from NCbirths. 

```{r}
table(df$marital)
```



2. A barchart of marital status (same as above)

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(marital)) + geom_bar()
```



3. A barchart of the type of plane (`planes$engine`) with the levels displayed in increasing frequency order. 

```{r}
library(forcats)
ggplot(planes, aes(engine)) + geom_bar() 
ggplot(planes, aes(fct_infreq(engine))) + geom_bar() # re-order by freq
ggplot(planes, aes(fct_rev(fct_infreq(engine)))) + geom_bar() # re-order by DECREASING freq
```



4. A histogram of mothers age (`mage`) with an overlaid density plot in a different color. Be sure that both density curve and histogram can be seen. 

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(mage)) + geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..)) + geom_density()
```



5. A horizontal boxplot of weight of the baby (`weight`)
I don't care how they make this plot, so long as it looks like a horizontal boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(0, weight)) + geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()
```


# Bivariate plots

6. Create a two-way frequency table of maturity status (`mature`) against smoking `habit`

```{r}
table(df$mature, df$habit)
```


7. Create a proportion table of smoking habit _within_ maturity status. Round to 3 digits. 

```{r}
table(df$mature, df$habit) %>% prop.table(margin=1) %>% round(3)
```



8. Create a grouped barchart that reflects the frequencies you calculated above. Think carefully which variable goes on the `x` axis, and which one is used for the `fill`

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(mature, fill=habit)) + geom_bar(position="dodge")
```


9. A scatterplot of length of pregnancy in `weeks` and the babies `weight`. Include a smoother line in brown, and a best fit linear model line in purple
    
```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(weeks, weight)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, color="brown") + 
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="lm", color="purple")

```
    
10. Grouped boxplots of baby `weight` by mothers smoking `habit`. Make sure you `fill` the boxes by `habit` as well. 

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(habit, weight, fill=habit)) + geom_boxplot()
```


11. Replicate the same plot as above, but overlay a violin plot and change the transparency of both violin and boxplot layers. 

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(habit, weight, fill=habit)) + 
  geom_boxplot(width=.1) +
  geom_violin(alpha=.1)
```


12. Overlaid density plots of weight `gained` by babies `gender`. Do not apply a `fill`, only use the `color` aesthetic. 

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(gained, color=gender)) + geom_density()
```
