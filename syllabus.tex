\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and
running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical
programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible
research and literate programming for data analysis. The target audience
is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will
cumulate with an peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a
pre-specified data set or your data set of choice.

\hypertarget{learning-outcomes}{%
\section{Learning Outcomes}\label{learning-outcomes}}

By the end of the course, students will be able to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Import data into R from external files such as text files and
  spreadsheets.
\item
  Calculate summary statistics.
\item
  Create new variables using different data types.
\item
  Perform data management techniques such as subsetting, grouping,
  summarizing.
\item
  Create informative data visualizations and tables.
\item
  Create a reproducible research document.
\item
  Conduct an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section{Required Materials}\label{required-materials}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A reliable laptop, chromebook, tablet that can use a browser to access
  the internet.
\item
  Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{software}{%
\paragraph{Software}\label{software}}

If you have your own PC/Mac/*nix computer, you are advised to install R
and R Studio on your personal computer. That way you can take what
you've learned in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are
free. Walk through installation instructions can be found here:
\url{https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R version 4.0.0 or later. Download from
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}
\item
  R Studio version 1.39 or later. Download the desktop version from
  \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\#download}
\end{itemize}

If you are unable to obtain a laptop that has the ability to install
program (i.e.~a iPad or Chromebook) then a cloud version of R and R
Studio is available to you at no charge. Learn more and make an account
here: \url{https://rstudio.cloud/}.

\hypertarget{time-commitment}{%
\section{Time Commitment}\label{time-commitment}}

\begin{quote}
For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the
``credit hour'' is defined as \ldots{} not less than one hour of
classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of
out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for
one semester or trimester hour of credit.
\end{quote}

This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class during
these 5 weeks. That's 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework per
week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers, you
may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient time
during week 5 to work on the project.

You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is just
a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will not
learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel
proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path
where you can continue to learn and improve.

\hypertarget{everyone-is-welcome-here}{%
\subsection{Everyone is welcome here}\label{everyone-is-welcome-here}}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity
of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities
(including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To
help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that
  appear in your official Chico records, please let me know!
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
  your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
  talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
  also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general
  announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
\item
  If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office
  of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
  530-898-4764, and email
  \href{mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}{\nolinkurl{diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}}
\item
  I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse
  perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
  anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
  (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on the
traditional lands of the Mechoopda people. Without them, we would not
have access to this campus or our education.

Students are expected to be familiar with the University's Academic
Integrity Policy. Your own commitment to learning, as evidenced by your
enrollment at California State University, Chico, and the University's
Academic Integrity Policy requires you to be honest in all your academic
course work. Faculty members are required to report all infractions to
the Office of Student Judicial Affairs. The policy on academic integrity
and other resources related to student conduct can be found on the
Student Judicial Affairs web site at
