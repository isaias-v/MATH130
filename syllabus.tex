\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and
running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical
programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible
research and literate programming for data analysis. The target audience
is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will
cumulate with an peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a
pre-specified data set or your data set of choice.

\hypertarget{learning-outcomes}{%
\section{Learning Outcomes}\label{learning-outcomes}}

By the end of the course, students will be able to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Import data into R from external files such as text files and
  spreadsheets.
\item
  Calculate summary statistics.
\item
  Create new variables using different data types.
\item
  Perform data management techniques such as subsetting, grouping,
  summarizing.
\item
  Create informative data visualizations and tables.
\item
  Create a reproducible research document.
\item
  Conduct an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section{Required Materials}\label{required-materials}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A reliable laptop, chromebook, tablet that can use a browser to access
  the internet.
\item
  Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{software}{%
\paragraph{Software}\label{software}}

During this class you will install R and R Studio on your personal
computer (Mac/PC/*nix only). That way you can take what you've learned
in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are free. Walk through
installation instructions can be found here:
\url{https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R version 3.5.0 or later. Download from
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}
\item
  R Studio version 1.2 or later. Download the desktop version from
  \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\#download}
\end{itemize}

If you are unable to obtain a laptop that has the ability to install
program (i.e.~a iPad or Chromebook) then a cloud version of R and R
Studio is available to you at no charge. Learn more and make an account
here: \url{https://rstudio.cloud/}.

\hypertarget{time-commitment}{%
\section{Time Commitment}\label{time-commitment}}

\begin{quote}
For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the
``credit hour'' is defined as \ldots{} not less than one hour of
classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of
out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for
one semester or trimester hour of credit.
\end{quote}

This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class during
these 5 weeks. That's 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework per
week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers, you
may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient time
during week 5 to work on the project.

You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is just
a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will not
learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel
proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path
where you can continue to learn and improve.
