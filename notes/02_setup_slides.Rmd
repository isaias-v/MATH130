# Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson learners will be able to:

* Use R and R Studio on their personal computer. 
* Describe the purpose of the RStudio Script, Console, Environment, and Plots panes.
* Organize files and directories for a set of analyses as an R Project, and understand the purpose of the working directory.
* Execute simple commands in the console
* Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R functions.
* Demonstrate how to provide sufficient information for troubleshooting with the R user community.

## Icon Definitions
* `r emo::ji("arrow_forward")` Forward arrow: Task for you to do
* `r emo::ji("arrow_down_small")` Down arrow: A download link is present. 
* `r emo::ji("x")` Red X: Something you should NOT do
* `r emo::ji("warning")` Warning triangle: this is something you should be aware of or pay attention to.

# Installing programs

`r emo::ji("warning")` If you are using a tablet, Chromebook or otherwise do not have a computer that you can install programs on, head over to http://rstudio.cloud.com, make an account and start a new project. [Then skip to slide #6](#intro_rstudio) to learn how to navigate RStudio. 

While the cloud is easier to initially setup, I want you to only use it if you absolutely have to. Having your own installation on your computer ensures that

* you likely want to customize your programs
* you will be able to put your files under version control
* you always have access to your code even with unstable or no internet

R is the programming language that we will be using. R Studio is the program we will _use_ R through. 

You must install both.

# Setting preferences in R Studio

##  Retain sanity while troubleshooting

`r emo::ji("arrow_forward")` 

* Open R Studio and go to the file menu go to _Tools_ then _Global Options_.
* Uncheck "Restore .RData into workspace at startup" 
* Where it says "Save workspace to .RData on exit:" Select "Never""
* Click apply then ok to close that window.
  
This will ensure that when you restart R you do not "carry forward" objects such as data sets that you were working on in a prior assignment.

# Setup your folder for success!

Using a consistent folder structure across your projects will help keep things
organized, and will also make it easy to find/file things in the future. This
can be especially helpful when you have multiple projects.


.pull-left[
<br><br>
`r emo::ji("arrow_forward")` On your computer, in an easy to find place, create a new folder named `math130`. Then create three subfolders: `data`, `homework`, `notes`.  ]

.pull-right[
<img src="../static/img/folder_org.png" width="250px">
]


You need to choose a naming convention for your class folder and stick with it. Recommended options are: 

* ALL CAPS (`MATH130`)
* no caps (`math130`)
* snake_case (`math_130`) 
* CamelCase (`Math130`)

# Adding files into your class folder

When you download a file, right click and "Save as" or "Save target as" and **actively choose** where to download this file.

`r emo::ji("x")` Do not let files live in your downloads folder. 

`r emo::ji("x")` Do not open any files from your browser window after downloading.


`r emo::ji("arrow_down_small")` Right click [[this link]](../hw/hw1.Rmd) to download and save Assignment 1 into your `homework` folder now.

# Programming with R

---

# Terminology

The basis of programming is that we write down instructions for the computer to
follow, and then we tell the computer to follow those instructions. 

We write, or *code*, instructions in R because it is a common language that both the computer and we can understand. 

We call the instructions *commands* and we tell the computer to follow the instructions by *executing* (also called *running*) those commands.

The **console** pane is the place where commands written in the R
language can be typed and executed immediately by the computer. It is also where
the results will be shown for commands that have been executed. 

You can type commands directly into the console and press <kbd>`Enter`</kbd> to execute those commands, but they will be forgotten when you close the session.

---
# Doing Math

`r emo::ji("arrow_forward")` In the console type the following code.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
2+2
```

You can do basic arithmetic this way. R is basically an overgrown calculator. 
Try a more complicated equation next. 

```r
2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log10)
```

Uh oh, we got an <span style="color:red">Error</span>. Let's try to fix it. 

```r
2 + 5*(8^3)- 3*log(10
```

Notice the console shows a `+` prompt. This means that you haven't finished entering
a complete command. This is because you have not 'closed' a parenthesis or
quotation, i.e. you don't have the same number of left-parentheses as
right-parentheses, or the same number of opening and closing quotation marks.
When this happens, and you thought you finished typing your command, click
inside the console window and press <kbd>`Esc`</kbd>; this will cancel the incomplete
command and return you to the `>` prompt.

---

`r emo::ji("arrow_forward")` Fix the math expression by closing the parenthesis.

# Final Tips 

## Saving and closing your work. 

Unless you're returning to work in R Studio in a short while, You should make a habit to save all open tabs and completely shut down R studio when you are done working. This ensures your environment is cleared. _This is a good thing._

## Restart R

To restart R without shutting the entire window down, go to the file menu bar in the top, 

> _Session_ --> Restart R and Clear Output

This is good to do when switching between projects/classes.
