	- Prior to the start of the semester the logistical information will be updated by Robin. 
	- Office hours will have to be added by the instructor. 
* Modifying the syllabus. 
	- If you are the only instructor for the term you are free to re-order the sections of the syllabus and/or adjust to fit your class.
		- Don't delete text, only comment it out.  
	- If there are multiple instructors for the term, it is up to you all to decide what to do with any desired adjustments to the syllabus. 
		- If you want to create entirely separate syllabi, the link in the navbar (`_site.yml`) can be commented out. 
* Methods of homework submission are left up to the instructor entirely.
