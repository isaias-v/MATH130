# Common Error Messages
Taken from: http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2015/03/the-most-common-r-error-messages.html

* `could not find function` errors, usually caused by typos or not loading a required package
* `Error in if` errors, caused by non-logical data or missing values passed to R's `if` conditional statement
* `Error in eval` errors, caused by references to objects that don't exist
* `cannot open` errors, caused by attempts to read a file that doesn't exist or can't be accessed
* `no applicable method` errors, caused by using an object-oriented function on a data type it doesn't support
* `subscript out of bounds` errors, caused by trying to access an element or dimension that doesn't exist
* package errors caused by being unable to install, compile or load a package.
    
    
# Where can I get help using R outside of class time? 

### Online
* Chico [R User Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chico-rug) Google email list and discussion board. 
    - Contribute your own solutions and advice as you can. 
* Stack Overflow using the `R` tag https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r 
    - Both of these are most helpful when you prepare a [minimal working example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example) of your problem for the other users.
